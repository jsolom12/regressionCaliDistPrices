# California Housing Price Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to predict median house values in Californian districts, given a number of features from these districts.
We build and train a model using a Decision Tree Regressor and assess its performance using various metrics.

## Data Description
The dataset includes data such as longitude, latitude, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms,
population, households, median income, median house value, and the ocean proximity. The main target variable is the median house value.

## Files and Folders
- `housing.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.
- `data/`: Folder containing the data file `housing.csv` used in the model.
- `models/`: This folder contains the trained model file `housing_model.pkl`, which can be loaded to predict new data.
